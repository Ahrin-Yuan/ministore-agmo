| **Responsiveness** | Optimized for screens 360px and wider. |

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
|  **Browse Products** | View a grid of product cards (emoji, title, price). |
|  **Search & Filter** | Filter by text, category, and price range. |
|  **Product Detail Page** | Shows full details (description, category, emoji, price). |
|  **Cart Management** | Add/remove items, update quantity, and calculate subtotal. |
|  **Persistence** | Cart and theme stored in browser `localStorage`. |
|  **Theming** | Light/Dark mode toggle saved between sessions. |
|  **Routing** | `/` (Home) and `/product/:id` (ProductDetail) routes with React Router. |
|  **Accessibility** | ARIA roles, focus styles, and logical tab navigation. |
|  **Responsiveness** | Works seamlessly across mobile and desktop. |

## Setup & run commands
### MiniStore - Tech Stack

- **React** 19.1.1
- **React DOM** 19.1.1
- **React Router** 7.9.4
- **Vite** 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahrin-Yuan/ministore-agmo.git
cd ministore-agmo
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (Vite's default port).

**To use a custom port:**

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 8080
```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Build the app for production (outputs to `dist/`) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |

### Deployment

#### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   - Ensure your repository is pushed to GitHub (public or private)

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Click **Import Project** and select your GitHub repository

3. **Zero-Configuration Setup**
   - **Framework Preset:** When you push new code to your linked Git repository, *Vercel automatically detects your framework*, builds and deploys the changes to a new, live version of your website.

4. **Set Environment Variable**
   - Add the following environment variable in Vercel:
     ```
     VITE_BASE_PATH = ./
     ```
   - This ensures the app serves correctly from the root domain.

5. **Deploy**
   - Click **Deploy** and Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app.
   - Future pushes to your connected branch will trigger automatic deployments.

#### Deployment Notes

In `vite.config.js`, I've defined:
```
export default defineConfig({
  base: process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH || '/task-tracker-webby/',
});
```
##### Purpose: Allow app to build correctly across different hosting environments
- **When running locally or on GitHub Pages**: The `vite.config.js` includes a `base` path configuration that defaults to `/task-tracker-webby/` (subdirectory deployments).
- **When deploying on Vercel**: Set `VITE_BASE_PATH` =  value `(./)` in Environment Variable. 
    - `/task-tracker-webby/` is overrided by `(./)` for root-level deployments (like Vercel). 
    - Vercel uses the environment variable `(./)` you set, ensuring correct relative asset paths.

-> This flexible setup allows deployment to both root domains and subdirectories without code changes.


### Troubleshooting

#### Missing Scripts Error

If you encounter missing script errors, verify your `package.json` contains:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

#### Port Already in Use

If port 5173 is occupied, Vite will automatically try the next available port, or you can specify a custom port, for example:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 8888
```

## Testing

### Approach
For this project, testing was done **manually** through the browser console and user interface interactions to verify that all key functionalities worked as intended.  
Although no automated test suite (e.g., Jest or React Testing Library) was set up, each core user flow was tested multiple times to ensure stability and responsiveness.

### Focus Areas
| Feature Tested | Verification |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Filter & Search Logic** | Ensure the function such as filtering by text, category, and price range works and clears the information when “Clear Filters” is clicked. |
| **Product Rendering** | Verified all product cards render properly and that each Product Detail page loads correct data from `products.json`. |
| **Cart Operations** | Tested add/remove, quantity updates, and subtotal calculations in real-time. |
| **Persistence** | Checked that cart items and theme preferences persist across page reloads using `localStorage`. |
| **Navigation & Routing** | Ensured smooth transitions between Home (`/`) and Product Detail (`/product/:id`) routes. |
| **Responsiveness** | Used browser dev tools to confirm layout and components scale correctly across various viewport widths (min. 360px). |

---

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

| Aspect | Assumption / Decision | Trade-off / Limitation |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Data Fetching** | Assumed a static product list is enough, so used local `products.json` with simulated delay. | No real API calls; can’t demonstrate async error handling or server updates. |
| **Data Persistence** | Assumed users shop from one device, so used `localStorage` for cart and theme as temporary solution to save/load data from Browser Storage. | No cross-device sync; not embodying offline-first architecture. |
| **Styling** | Used plain CSS for simplicity and control. | Slower to style compared to utility-first frameworks. |
| **Testing** | Skipped test setup to focus on working features. | No automated test coverage despite having testable logic. |
| **Accessibility** | Used emojis as substitute for images; applied `role="img"` and ARIA attributes for screen readers. | Limited support for screen readers versus real images with alt text. |
| **Performance** | Optimized for clarity, not speed. | Lacks lazy-loading or code-splitting optimizations. |

## What I’d Do With More Time

| Area | Improvement |
|------|--------------|
| **TypeScript Implementation** | Convert React.js to Typescript. Add type safety with interfaces for product, cart, and API response. |
| **Testing** | Implement unit and component tests (using Jest + React Testing Library) for filter logic, cart operations, and rendering of product cards/details. |
| **Performance** | Enable image and component lazy-loading, optimize bundle size, and improve Core Web Vitals for faster initial load. |
| **Modularity** | Further break down components into smaller, reusable pieces and extract logic into custom hooks. |
| **Theming** | Improvise light/dark themes and add custom theme options. |
| **Offline-first** | Introduce a Service Worker to cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, and products.json) so the app remains functional even when offline. |
| **Internationalization (i18n)** | Add language support (e.g., English + one additional language toggle). |

## Time Spent & Priorities

| Category | Details |
|-----------|----------|
| **Total Time Spent** | ~Est 10-15 hours (one full day). |
| **Main Priorities** | Clean architecture, responsive UI, working functional logic, building intuitive UI interfaces and persistent state. |
| **Focus Areas** | User experience, accessibility, and modular React components. |

## AI Assistance Transparency

| Tool Used | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude** | Used for guidance, optimization, and feedback. Helped improve modularity, readability, and code organization. Improve my coding intuition and consider building intuitive layout based from user's experience. |

All structural architecture, integration decisions, and code implementation were **done manually** by me. AI assistance served as a **supporting tool** for improving workflow efficiency, enhance code readability and maintaining clean architecture.
